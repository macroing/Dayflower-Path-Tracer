2020-02-19	Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A selected Primitive can now be moved in various directions. You use your Camera movement keys to do so.
	* ADD:		A Transform has been added to each Primitive instance. It can be used to transform their position, rotation and scale.

2019-11-17  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new scene has been added. It's called "Zealot_Scene".

2019-11-06  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The algorithm to create shadow rays for the sun has been updated.

2019-09-25  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new BullseyeTexture has been added. Because the numbers associated with all Texture implementations are based on their names in alphabetic order, most Texture implementations will be associated with a new number.
	* CHANGE:	Update version to 0.1.6.
	* CHANGE:	Update to the latest version of Image4J and Math4J.

2019-09-15  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A dependency to the library Math4J has been added.
	* ADD:		A dependency to the library Image4J has been added.
	* ADD:		Explicit sun lighting has been added. It can be toggled in the GUI.
	* REMOVE:	The class Image in the package org.dayflower.pathtracer.util has been removed. It has been replaced by Image4J.
	* REMOVE:	All classes and interfaces in the package org.dayflower.pathtracer.color have been removed. They have been replaced by Image4J.
	* REMOVE:	All classes and interfaces in the package org.dayflower.pathtracer.color.colorspace have been removed. They have been replaced by Image4J.
	* REMOVE:	All classes and interfaces in the package org.dayflower.pathtracer.color.spectralcurve have been removed. They have been replaced by Image4J.
	* REMOVE:	All classes and interfaces in the package org.dayflower.pathtracer.math have been removed. They have been replaced by Math4J.

2019-08-25  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new UVTexture class has been added.

2019-08-20  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new surface normal renderer has been added. It will render the surface normals of all surfaces.
	* ADD:		A simple loading screen has been added. It is shown in the Canvas when things are loading.
	* ADD:		A new AbstractImageKernel class has been created. The responsibility for this class is the rendering pipeline. It supports Monte Carlo-method based moving agerage sampling, tone mapping, gamma correction and additional effects. All subclasses use this rendering pipeline to render.
	* CHANGE:	Primitive selection did not work as expected in the Ambient Occlusion renderer. This has been fixed.

2019-08-18  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* REMOVE:	The cloud feature has been removed. It was experimental and did not look good. If a better algorithm is found, it will be added again.

2019-08-17  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new modified version of the Reinhard tone mapper has been added.
	* REMOVE:	All effects have been removed from the window. The source code for the effects has been moved to the Image class, with some modifications. The effects only existed because I wanted to test various image processing algorithms.
	* REMOVE:	The Linear tone mapper and the old Filmic Curve tone mapper have been removed. The Linear tone mapper did not look good and the old Filmic Curve tone mapper handled gamma correction on its own, which made the default gamma correction code more complicated than it had to be.

2019-08-01  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		It's now possible to change the exposure for all Tone Mappers in the GUI.

2019-07-31  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		All public API:s have been fully documented with Javadocs. Improvements may of course still be done over time.
	* ADD:		A new BlendTexture class has been added. Its constructors take two Textures as parameter arguments. When rendering, they are blended together. These two Textures cannot themselves be BlendTextures, however. This restriction might be fixed in a future version.
	* CHANGE:	The Material API has been changed. Previously the Material type was an enum. Now it is an interface and we have five implementations of it so far.

2019-07-26  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The scene model and the renderer have been rewritten almost entirely, in order to optimize the memory requirement.
	* CHANGE:	The emission color of surfaces have been replaced with emission textures. This allows for partially emissive objects, or objects that vary in color over the surface.
	* REMOVE:	All scenes except House_Scene, Material_Showcase_Scene and Monkey_Scene have been removed temporarily. They need to be re-implemented because of the scene model change.

2019-07-23  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The rendering speed has been optimized. Two of the arrays in RendererKernel have been changed to use private memory space, instead of local memory space. Doing the same change with the other arrays seems to undo this optimization.

2019-07-21  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) building algorithm has been optimized.
	* CHANGE:	It's now possible to configure the camera for a specific scene.

2019-07-20  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		Wireframe rendering has been added. It's possible to enable or disable this feature with a menu item checkbox.
	* CHANGE:	Image-based normal mapping does not use bilinear interpolation anymore.
	* CHANGE:	The exposure of the new Filmic Curve tone mapper has been changed to 1.0.

2019-07-16  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	Aparapi has been updated to a new version that supports arbitrary function implementation order.

2019-07-14  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A menu item for saving the current image to disk has been added. It does not overwrite existing files.
	* CHANGE:	Normal mapping has been turned on by default.
	* CHANGE:	The default camera position, or eye, has been updated. It now looks at all spheres in the default scene.

2019-07-13  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		The maximum distance for the Ambient Occlusion renderer can now be changed by a slider.

2019-07-12  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new Filmic Curve tone mapper has been added. It is enabled by default. The previous Filmic Curve tone mapper still exists.

2019-07-11  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		The Ambient Occlusion renderer now supports a maximum distance. It is set to 200.0.

2019-06-04  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The Ray Caster, Ray Marcher and Ray Tracer renderers have been updated with a new better Phong reflection model shader.

2019-06-02  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The texture of the terrain for the Ray Marcher renderer has been updated. It uses a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) texture.

2019-05-26  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The algorithm of the Ray Tracer has been updated.
	* REMOVE:	Ambient Occlusion rendering has been removed from the Ray Caster renderer.

2019-01-02  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) traversal algorithm has been optimized.
	* REMOVE:	The Bloom effect has been removed.
