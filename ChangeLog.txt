	* CHANGE:	The scene model and the renderer have been rewritten almost entirely, in order to optimize the memory requirement.
	* CHANGE:	The emission color of surfaces have been replaced with emission textures. This allows for partially emissive objects, or objects that vary in color over the surface.
	* REMOVE:	All scenes except House_Scene, Material_Showcase_Scene and Monkey_Scene have been removed temporarily. They need to be re-implemented because of the scene model change.

	* CHANGE:	The rendering speed has been optimized. Two of the arrays in RendererKernel have been changed to use private memory space, instead of local memory space. Doing the same change with the other arrays seems to undo this optimization.

	* CHANGE:	The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) building algorithm has been optimized.
	* CHANGE:	It's now possible to configure the camera for a specific scene.

2019-07-20  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		Wireframe rendering has been added. It's possible to enable or disable this feature with a menu item checkbox.
	* CHANGE:	Image-based normal mapping does not use bilinear interpolation anymore.
	* CHANGE:	The exposure of the new Filmic Curve tone mapper has been changed to 1.0.

	* CHANGE:	Aparapi has been updated to a new version that supports arbitrary function implementation order.

2019-07-14  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A menu item for saving the current image to disk has been added. It does not overwrite existing files.
	* CHANGE:	Normal mapping has been turned on by default.
	* CHANGE:	The default camera position, or eye, has been updated. It now looks at all spheres in the default scene.

2019-07-13  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		The maximum distance for the Ambient Occlusion renderer can now be changed by a slider.

2019-07-12  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		A new Filmic Curve tone mapper has been added. It is enabled by default. The previous Filmic Curve tone mapper still exists.

2019-07-11  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		The Ambient Occlusion renderer now supports a maximum distance. It is set to 200.0.

2019-06-04  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The Ray Caster, Ray Marcher and Ray Tracer renderers have been updated with a new better Phong reflection model shader.

2019-06-02  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The texture of the terrain for the Ray Marcher renderer has been updated. It uses a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) texture.

2019-05-26  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The algorithm of the Ray Tracer has been updated.
	* REMOVE:	Ambient Occlusion rendering has been removed from the Ray Caster renderer.

2019-01-02  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* CHANGE:	The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) traversal algorithm has been optimized.
	* REMOVE:	The Bloom effect has been removed.
